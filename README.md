# Facebook--Footsteps-Prediction

### Project Idea

The idea is to predict where a user could be checking into from their location and timestamp. This project was a coding challenge on kaggle.com, and the dataset we are using is from the website itself.

A system which could classify and analyze social media check-in data to find patterns on how users check-in activity would be beneficial for the customers and businesses. Although, achieving this would never have a hundred percent accuracy, but a good prediction would certainly do wonders for both.

### Applications

1. See the most common places of interests as per the geographical area.
2. Allow businesses to promote themselves as per customer check-ins and find ways to improve and work on customer retention
3. Realize how customer visit places as per the seasons, days, hours, etc. More check-ins in evening could be a sign of restaurant outings and allow to find favorable eating joints.
4. Allow users to find the most visited hangout places around.
5. Allow tourists to better plan their trips highlighting how people go about visiting a city and area as per different time of the day.
6. Customized offers and personalized customer based advertising on social media and other networks.
